  - title: Vacuum Energy from Qubit Entropy

    abstract: We develop a non-conventional description of the vacuum energy in quantum field theory in terms of quantum entropy. Precisely, we show that the vacuum energy of any non-interacting quantum field at zero temperature is proportional to the quantum entropy of the qubit degrees of freedom associated with virtual fluctuations. We prove this for fermions first, and then extend the derivation to quanta of any spin. Finally, we use these results to obtain the first law of thermodynamics for a non-interacting quantum vacuum at zero temperature.
    
  - title: Multipartite Entanglement from Consecutive Scatterings
    authors: Gonçalo M. Quinta, Rui André
    year: 2023

    arxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11102
    abstract: We study how the successive scattering of spin 1/2 particles with a central spin 1/2 target particle can generate entanglement between the helicity degrees of freedom of all scattered particles, effectively producing a multipartite entangled state. We show that the bipartite entanglement between each pair of scattered particles, as quantified by the concurrence, is largest for reflected particles and decreases with the number of scatterings. We study the entanglement generation as a function of the scattered particles momenta, angular distribution and mass ratios, and show that there is always a combination of optimal helicities and momentum which generate the largest amount of bipartite entanglement.

  - title: The Qubit Picture of Virtual Particles
    authors: Gonçalo M. Quinta
    year: 2022

    doi: 'https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.108.012424'
    arxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05782
    abstract: We show that a virtual fermion, despite being unobservable, can be described by a quantum state in momentum space under certain conditions. We prove that such a state can be regarded as a 2-qubit mixed state, where the qubits are physically associated to particle type and spin. We show that the mixed state is a separable combination of entangled pure states, whose entanglement is proportional to the transverse momentum norm. Lastly, we show that this state is always thermal. These findings represent a new connection between quantum field theory, quantum information and quantum thermodynamics.

  - title: Predicting leptonic CP violation via minimization of neutrino entanglement
    authors: Gonçalo M. Quinta, Alexandre Sousa, Yasser Omar
    year: 2022
    selected: true
    arxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03303
    abstract: We show how a minimization principle of quantum entanglement between the oscillating flavors of a neutrino leads to a unique prediction for the CP-violation phase in the neutrino sector without assuming extra symmetries in the Standard Model. We find a theoretical prediction consistent with either no CP-violation or a very small presence of it.
