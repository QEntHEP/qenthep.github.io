## Objectives
<div style="text-align: justify">

1. Quantum entanglement and fundamental constants: Investigate the possible of role of quantum entanglement in fixing the values of fundamental constants in high energy physics.

2. Study multi-partite entanglement in particle interactions: Study how entanglement is generated between the quantum degrees of particles present in multiple scatterings.

3. Quantum information in quantum field theory: Identify how fundamental quantities in quantum field theory may be expressed in qubit language and explore new interpretations that tools from quantum information may bring.
