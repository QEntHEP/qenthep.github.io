# QEntHEP Project Webpage


## 🚀 Quickstart

You can easily edit any markdown files (`.md` or `.mdx`) directly on the repository. Changes are applied on every push to the `main` branch.

Look for these files under `src/pages` and `src/content` directories.

Images should be placed under `src/assets` directory and linked accordingly.
